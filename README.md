# Auction-Insights-Automation
A script that automates Google Ads auction insights reports using the Google Sheets and Google Drive API's for use in Google Data Studio. Written in JavaScript.

# Motivation
Google Ads provides detailed custom reports for comparing how often you win bets on certain keywords ("auctions") against your competitors (if you are interested: for more information click here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjgDWOXXmtc or here https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2579754?hl=en). These reports are of high value to campaign managers who want to optimize their bidding strategy and who ultimately want to employ their limited budget with a higher leverage. Unfortunately, up to this point these reports can only be accessed from within the Google Ads user interface, which makes it complicated to create custom reports in data visualization tools like Google Data Studio, Power BI or Tableau. This Script make it possible to bring your data from Google Ads to your preferred BI Tool, while updating your data in regular intervals. Once set-up, the script will take care of the rest and you can concentrate on optimizing your campaigns and/or reports.
